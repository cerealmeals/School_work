Question 1
    I got better results with the Kalman smoothing,
    I couldn't get the LOESS smoothing to ever follow the peaks enough.
    I had enough trouble getting to Kalman smoothing to do it.
Question 2
    Speed could definitely be helpful in providing a bound to how far you could
    move every observation. Heading can also be a good sanity check to make sure the 
    movement is in the correct direction.

As a final note I can see that my calculations are wrong for the data.
I had 3 other assignments so this one was last priority I am handing this 
in before the late penlty but hope the incorectness is worth less than 20%
