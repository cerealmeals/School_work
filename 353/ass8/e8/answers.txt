Question 1:
    HSV seemed to work best for GaussianNB classifier
    LAB seemed to work best for the other two K-means and random forrest

    Even thought the pictures I find to be better when RGB is used
    the scores tell a different story.
    
    I think HSV worked best for GaussianNB because only one varriable is change to change colour.

Question 2:
    Most mistakes it made were between cities that are close in distance and thus have similar weather.
    Although it mistakes with London were really bad.
    Maybe adding wind speeds would help diferentiate between different places.
