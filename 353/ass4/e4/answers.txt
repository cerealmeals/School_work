Question 1
    No I do not think temperatures are a good way to predict population density.
    The data is all over the place, most of the data is scattered in one area meaning
    there is almost no relation as you can see from the r^2 value

Question 2
    Working with a compressed json file is faster because getting the compressed file
    from disk to memory is faster when it is compressed. Because memory is so slow, decoding
    the compressing is faster then loading an uncompressed version
