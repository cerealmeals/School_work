    (4) 0m5.917s

Question 2
    Most of the time spend is reading the file, if you find ways to reduce
    the amount of times it reads the file the time goes down.

    between starting spark and doing nothing, and reading the file once with caching
    is ~2 so calculating takes very little time.
