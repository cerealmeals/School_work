Question 1
    Fix 2 (the central limit theorem) got the closest 
    to satisfying the assumpyions of a T-test

Question 2
    T-test: would answer the question asked, are there a different number of Reddit comments
    posted on weekdays than on weekends, if you reject the null hypothesis you can say
    yes there are a different number of comments posted on weekdays than on weekends.

Question 3
    I think the central limit theorem approache works best because it shows the means
    of each week and weekend.
Question 4
    on average more comments are posted on weekdays to r/canada
